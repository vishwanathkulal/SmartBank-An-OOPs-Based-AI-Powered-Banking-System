# SmartBank-An-OOPs-Based-AI-Powered-Banking-System
SmartBank is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)-based banking system that integrates account management, transaction handling, and AI-powered chatbot assistance. It allows users to create Savings or Current accounts, perform deposits and withdrawals, check their balance and transaction history, and get instant banking support.
The project utilizes OOPs concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to ensure a modular, secure, and scalable system. Additionally, it incorporates RoBERTa (deepset/roberta-base-squad2) for AI-based chatbot functionality, offering instant answers to banking-related queries.

This project is ideal for academic learning, industry applications, and project-based learning, demonstrating real-world banking functionalities in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
